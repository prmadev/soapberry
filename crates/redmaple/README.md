`RedMaple` offers an opinionated yet extremely flexible data modeling system based on events for backend applications

`RedMaple` is still in its infancy. And for now, at least, it is not fully formed.
There is a 100 % certainty that if I can, I will strip away some items in it.
So please, do not use it for now. Version numbering will tell you if things got stabilised.
