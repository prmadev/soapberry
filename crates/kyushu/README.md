`kyushu` is an opinionated way of journalling and contemplating about your life.

For now `kyushu` is still in its infancy. I suggest that you do not use it for now.
But it should be awesome when it reaches a  stable core.

`kyushu` is proudly standing on the shoulders of [`RedMaple`](https://crates.io/crates/redmaple) library.
