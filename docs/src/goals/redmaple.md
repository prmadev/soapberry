# Goals of the RedMaple Crate

## Broader Goals

### Permanent

Redmaple is a very small crate, there is a reason for it.
The smaller something is, the more chance that it is maintainable.  
That's a rough rule of thumb,
but permanence being the top priority of this crate,
means that every rule of thumb is taken seriously. 

Some signs of reaching this goal are: 
1. It has very little external dependencies.
2. It is up-to-date with the latest Rust Idioms or it has documented reasons why it is not.
3. It has no bugs or obvious performance issues in the features it is offering.
4. It has a very little resource footprint.


### Finished

The project aims to be finished.
That means that within the scopes of the project,
it has fullfilled implementing all the features,
in an idiomatic way, and is only getting updated for performance, reliability or idiomacy reasons. 

Some signs of reaching this goal are: 
1. Fully documented within the code, using comments.
2. Fully documented within the book. 
3. Has full documentation for Architectural decisions, system design and specs. 
4. Tests-as-stabilization is done.
5. Has support for all of its intended targets.
