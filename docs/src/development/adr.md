# ADR

The Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a crucial artifact within our realm,
documenting pivotal decisions that shape the project's architecture.
It serves as a guide, ensuring coherence and continuity throughout the development process.
The ADR promotes transparency,
allowing future generations to understand the reasoning behind our choices.
It is an invaluable resource for navigating the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
